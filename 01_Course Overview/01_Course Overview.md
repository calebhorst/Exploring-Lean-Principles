## Course Overview
```
Hi, everyone. My name is Chris B. Behrens and welcome to my course, Exploring Lean Principles. Lean software development was developed on the foundation established by the Toyota Production System. Lean takes lessons learned over generations of industrial practice and applies them in an intelligent way to the craft of creating software. Some of the major topics that we will cover include understanding the relationship between Agile and Lean, identifying waste in software processes, and applying lean principles to your enterprise. By the end of this course, you will have the skills and knowledge to identify waste in your own processes and empower your people to do something about it. Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with software development in general. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn how to build quality in and eliminate waste with the Exploring Lean Principles course, at Pluralsight.
