## Introduction
```
Welcome to the course. I want to begin this course by staking out what we're talking about in terms of what Lean and Agile mean to each other. We're going to spend this first section installing some basic understanding of the entire course and then deepen our understanding of the relevant elements as we move ahead. I've worked for nearly 20 years or so with Agile and Lean processes, and while Agile has taken deep root in software development, Lean has gotten much less traction. And I think I understand why. Agile begins with the Agile Manifesto in 2001, while Lean begins with the Toyota Production System and the work of Sakichi Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno, in the early 20th century. I'm placing the origin here a little earlier than some sources, but everyone pretty much places the genesis of Lean manufacturing with Toyota. In my estimation, the difference between Lean and Agile is a matter of scope. Lean is strategy, and Agile is tactics. To draw another parallel, in warfare excellent tactics may allow you to take a hill very effectively, but this is pointless if it's the wrong hill strategically. Agile can allow you to do things right, while Lean helps you to do the right things. This is a point I want you to understand at the top. Lean is not an alternative or competing methodology to Agile. It is a supplement to Agile. In a real sense, Lean is Agile and Agile should be Lean. One of the principal tools and logic and philosophy is antithesis, defining a thing clearly by defining its opposite. When we say that a thing is Lean, we would understand its opposite to be fat. Jack Sprat could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean, and all of that. A fat process, most fundamentally, is going to have loads of waste of unnecessary and value‑detracting stuff. We'll put a much finer definition on waste later in the course. As a quick aside, there's an entire hilarious website devoted to this antithesis, FatManufacturing.com. Here you will find posts like Six Stigma and just‑too‑late manufacturing. Stuff that could only be written by a survivor of the antithesis of Lean processes. I've got stories directly from my career that illustrate why Agile tactics need Lean strategy. The first was a project I did for a large company looking to create an Internet of Things initiative. My team worked to create an Azure architecture that took data from IoT devices out in the world to several data stores. And then we wrote an admin interface that mapped all of this data out in beautiful scrolling charts. All of this running through continuously integrated bills and automated nightly deployments. Our team velocity was fantastic, easily three or four times the values reached by other teams, and after about six months, we were all fired. Though we'd been doing excellent work we could all be proud of, the problem we'd been solving turned out to be the wrong problem for the parent company to solve. After all this time, the company finally performed the analysis for what they could charge for their devices and the value to add for our architecture, and the numbers didn't add up. Our work was waste. Back in the fall of 2001, I worked for a large telecom that had the kind of problem that big companies have that they needed to keep track of the image assets they were using in their communications. I was tasked with creating a fuzzy language search where you can direct searches for girl to woman in women and that whole kind of thing. This is out of the box search stuff these days, but back then it was pretty fancy stuff, and it was rewarding work. This being 2001 Agile wasn't really around yet, but we kept careful track of time, and the development process was very efficient and effective. After the library was ready for deployment, I attended a meeting with the infrastructure team with about 30 other people in a huge conference room. Each project, looking to get a piece of hardware to deploy on, was speaking in turn, and it finally reached us. I laid out what kind of hardware I thought the system would need, and the infrastructure guys agreed that that was a good assessment and returned a dollar figure for deploying and maintaining that system. A higher up at this meeting indicated that that exceeded the required figure for the project, and we moved on to the next team seeking hardware. As I sat there for the next 40 or so minutes, 40 minutes of waste, by the way, it slowly dawned on me that the project I just spent the last four months working on was headed for the great digital dust bin in the sky. My work was waste. Lean processes rely on demand signals that pull projects into existence. These two examples, where cases where someone tried to push them into existence without truly answering the question of why it was needed. They were created just in case. They were created because they might turn out to be useful. It's easy to see the problems when a project is a development disaster, and it's easy to assign blame when the responsible parties are the relatively low prestige employees that developers typically are. But when projects run smoothly and cleanly towards completion, with the Agile metrics being met all along the way, it's easy to settle into fatalism. We did what Agile told us to do, and we still lost. This Agile stuff must just be the latest load of corporate double speak. But it's not. I believe passionately in Agile, though I do think we maybe lost our way and confused the tools with the job that the tools do in some cases. But to make Agile work, we have to have a clarifying set of principles which define the process we're using to reach our goal and what those goals should be. In the broadest sense, Lean won't help us if we're manufacturing SUVs when the market really wants sports cars or vice versa. That's got to be up to the true leaders of the business. But if we use Lean and Agile together effectively, Agile can help us get good answers, and Lean will help us make sure we're asking the right questions.

## Notes
- Lean software development is built upon the Toyota Production System and applies lessons from industrial practices to software development.
- The course aims to clarify the relationship between Lean and Agile methodologies.
- Lean is viewed as a strategic approach, while Agile is tactical.
- Lean is about doing the right things, whereas Agile focuses on doing things right.
- Lean is not an alternative to Agile but a supplement; both should work together.
- Lean is concerned with eliminating waste, which is anything that doesn't add value.
- The goal is to ensure that Agile tactics align with Lean strategy.
- Lean relies on demand signals to guide projects, avoiding unnecessary or wasteful work.
- A failure to identify the right problems or goals can result in wasted effort, even if Agile practices are followed.
- Combining Lean and Agile principles can help organizations ensure they are solving the right problems effectively.

These points lay the foundation for understanding the course's focus on Lean principles in software development.
