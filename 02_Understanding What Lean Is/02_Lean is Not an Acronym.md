## Lean is Not an Acronym
```
A quick point, just like Agile and Scrum, Lean is not an acronym. You will occasionally see backronyms for these, acronyms created after the fact. But Lean is just Lean. If you see Lean capitalized and job requirements or on the other side of the fence on a resume, you can tell that the person writing the document doesn't really know what Lean is. If you want the opposite, an indicator that the author may know what they're talking about. If you see Toyota Production System or TPS in reference to Lean, that is what this stuff was referred to as prior to 1988. In 1988 the current CEO of Waymo, John Krafcik, published a paper in the Sloan Management Review, "Triumph of the Lean Production System", coining the term Lean. It's only about 12 pages long, complete with charts, and I recommend you read it here. Let's talk about the Toyota Production System

## Notes
- Lean is not an acronym; it should be written as "Lean."
- The term "Lean" was introduced in 1988 by John Krafcik in his paper "Triumph of the Lean Production System."
- Previously, Lean was known as the Toyota Production System (TPS) before the adoption of the term "Lean."
- Lean and Agile are distinct methodologies, not acronyms.
- Indications of Lean knowledge can be found in references to the Toyota Production System or TPS.
- John Krafcik, now the CEO of Waymo, is credited with coining the term "Lean."
- Krafcik's paper, "Triumph of the Lean Production System," provides valuable insights into Lean principles.
