## The Toyota Production System
```
So what is the Toyota Production System? And what does an automobile manufacturing process have to teach us about software development? The story starts at the beginning of the 20th century, when Toyota was in fact a textile company. The journey from textiles to automobiles might not seem obvious, but when you understand the role of Lean manufacturing in this transition, it becomes clear. Sakichi Toyoda was born in 1867 to two craftsman or craftpersons, if you prefer. His father was a gifted carpenter and woodworker, while his mother was an expert weaver. As a child, Sakichi watched his mother work, working her loom back and forth over and over again. As a quick side note, the first step is to tie the threads of the warp, the vertical threads to a piece of cloth called the apron. The last step is to cut the apron strings when the piece is complete and ready to move on. Toyoda observed that the processes could be intelligently automated and coined the term, Jidoka, intelligent automation. Over many iterations, Toyoda created a loom, the Model G, which could run with nearly no operator intervention. And here's a key point, stopped automatically when a warp break a snapped longitudinal thread, was detected. You can watch a video of this exact process and about the two minute mark in this video. Four years after his father's death in 1930, Kiichiro Toyoda and a division of Toyota Industries produced a prototype, the Model A, a predecessor to the Model AA, shown here. In postwar Japan, Kiichiro knew that unless the company was able to do very much with very little, it would not survive. So he tasked the shop floor supervisor, Taiichi Ohno, with catching up with America, which was at that time eight times more productive in the automotive sector. In what would become his life's work, Taiichi Ohno designed the Toyota Production System and coined the term just‑in‑time. Just‑in‑time manufacturing meant that a part would be produced when it was needed, and not before, and in the quantity needed and no more. This is in contrast to just‑in‑case manufacturing, which means keeping parts on hand just in case. Ohno identified this practice as waste defined a set of precepts and principles to eliminate it.

## Notes
- The Toyota Production System (TPS) was developed by Toyota, originally a textile company, in the early 20th century.
- Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota, observed his mother's weaving process and realized the potential for intelligent automation, coining the term "Jidoka."
- Toyoda created the Model G loom, which could operate with minimal operator intervention and automatically stop when a thread break occurred.
- Kiichiro Toyoda, Sakichi's son, and Taiichi Ohno, a shop floor supervisor, played key roles in the development of TPS.
- After World War II, Kiichiro tasked Taiichi Ohno with catching up to American automotive productivity.
- Ohno developed the Toyota Production System and introduced the concept of "just-in-time" manufacturing, which focuses on producing parts when needed, in the right quantity, to eliminate waste.
- TPS principles aim to reduce waste and improve efficiency in manufacturing processes.
