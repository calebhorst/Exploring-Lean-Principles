## Mary and Tom Poppendieck
```
The work of applying this knowledge to software processes was performed first and mostly by Mary and Tom Poppendieck, a husband and wife team who wrote a landmark book in 2003; "Lean Software Development: an Agile Toolkit". They followed this with a number of books exploring Lean application, including their 2003 "Implementing Lean Software: From Concept to Cash". I have a terribly dog eared copy at hand while I'm creating this course. I cannot recommend strongly enough that you read it or its predecessor. The books are extremely accessible and are heavily story and historyâ€‘oriented, which means you'll remember what you read.
