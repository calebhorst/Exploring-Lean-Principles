## How Lean Happened at Toyota
```
The move from textiles to cars makes sense when we have the whole picture. Toyota Industries was uniquely, culturally, and organizationally equipped to work in complex manufacturing, thanks to the foundational work of Sakichi Toyoda. And driven by competition in the adversity of the postâ€‘World War II economy in Japan, Taichi Ono took the work of a genius, Sakichi Toyoda, and created something special. Of course, there wasn't really any transition at all. Toyota manufactures textile equipment to this very day, but that business has been outshone by the performance of its sibling automobile corporation. So we talked about what Lean is at the core and explored the history of the Toyota system, and Kanban and Kaizen, two concepts which arise naturally from Lean principles. Then we finished out with some notes about the Poppendieck's, the acknowledged parents of Lean software development. One last item before we move ahead. In my previous course, Determining Feasibility and Refining Requirements for Microsoft Azure, found here. I explored Lean manufacturing and how to create user stories in a Lean mindset in the section titled, Mitigating Risks With Good Requirements. Rather than recapitulate that content here, I recommend you check it out. There's a good story I pulled right from the Poppendieck book about Lean and the development of the Polaris missile system.

## Notes
- Toyota Industries had its origins in textiles and eventually transitioned to automobile manufacturing, thanks to the work of Sakichi Toyoda and the Toyota Production System.
- Taiichi Ohno played a crucial role in creating the Toyota Production System and implementing Lean principles in manufacturing.
- Toyota continues to manufacture textile equipment to this day, alongside its successful automobile business.
- Kanban and Kaizen are two fundamental concepts arising from Lean principles and have been applied in various industries, including software development.
- Mary and Tom Poppendieck are renowned for their contributions to Lean software development and have authored books that provide valuable insights into the topic.
- A previous course by the instructor explored Lean manufacturing and Lean mindset in user story creation, and interested learners are encouraged to check it out for more information.
