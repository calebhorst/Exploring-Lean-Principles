## Introduction
```
One of the fundamental truths that the Poppendieck's identified was that the Lean truths that apply to manufacturing don't map 1:1 to a software process. A key difference between software development and manufacturing is that software is, or at least should be, mostly research. If it's not research, that is, if the inputs and outputs are mostly predictable, that should be subject to Jidoka, intelligent automation, and then never done again. Keep that in mind in your day‑to‑day work, and that will take you a long way towards Lean. In their books, the Poppendieck's identify seven principles for Lean software development. Eliminate waste, build quality in, create knowledge, defer commitment, deliver fast, respect people, and optimize the whole. We're going to talk about all of these and how they apply in the real world.

## Notes
The Poppendiecks recognized that Lean principles applied to manufacturing do not directly translate to software development. One key distinction is that software development often involves research and innovation, making it different from predictable manufacturing processes. Their seven principles for Lean software development are:

1. Eliminate waste: Identify and eliminate unnecessary steps, processes, or work that does not add value to the software development process.

2. Build quality in: Focus on creating high-quality software from the start rather than relying on post-development testing and bug fixes.

3. Create knowledge: Encourage learning and the sharing of knowledge within the development team to improve processes and outcomes.

4. Defer commitment: Delay important decisions until the last responsible moment to allow for flexibility and adaptation as more information becomes available.

5. Deliver fast: Aim to deliver working software quickly and iteratively to obtain feedback and make necessary adjustments.

6. Respect people: Value and respect the contributions and expertise of individuals within the development team.

7. Optimize the whole: Look at the entire software development process as a whole system and seek to optimize it for efficiency and effectiveness.

These principles will be explored further in the context of real-world software development scenarios.
