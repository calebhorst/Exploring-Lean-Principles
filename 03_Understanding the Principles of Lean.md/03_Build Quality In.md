## Build Quality In
```
I remember working with a client and trying to sell them on the value of automated testing. The project had had some problems with delivery time, and it was always that testing at the end that took too long. That is to say, testing worked and found a bunch of defects that derailed the release. I explained what I had in mind and how it worked, and at the end I could tell he wasn't sold. He asked, How much extra time will this take? We're already taking too long to deliver. I tried to explain to him that the question was wrong and it couldn't effectively be answered. The point of implementing the automated testing was to decrease the overall time. Otherwise, it's pointless. But certainly for awhile it was going to increase our delivery time as developers came up to speed on how to do it, so he decided to veto the proposal. What I'd failed to make him understand is that testing is not to find problems, it is to prevent problems in the first place. When a developer knows that he's going to have to write an automated test to validate his code, he writes different code. He writes code so that it's testable, that it's interface is clean and accessible, and above all, that he has a clear picture of what right and wrong means for his function. If we reapply the manufacturing paradigm to this stuff, development and testing are stages on the assembly line. Imagine if Toyota assembled a car from frame to glove box and only tested whether every part was installed correctly right before it was rolled onto the truck to head to the dealership. Now, also imagine that instead of design parameters down to the micron, the line had a single sentence like implement cruise control. You might laugh, but even in 2020 that's about the extent of most small company's requirements. The price of fixing a bug increases over its lifetime. If you can spot a defect in the requirements, the cost is nearly nothing. If you spot a defect with an automated test during development, it will take longer to untangle what the defect is and how it should behave. I've worked for several healthcare data providers subject to HIPPA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the cost of a software defect with that kind of data can easily extend into millions. Principle two, build quality in. Let me point out here that if we do our job well with the first principle, eliminating waste, that enables our second principle. The most maintainable, best performing, and most extensively documented line of code is the one you never write.

## Notes
Building quality into the software development process is a fundamental principle of Lean software development. It emphasizes the importance of preventing defects and issues at every stage of the development lifecycle rather than trying to identify and fix them later. Quality should be a core focus from the very beginning, and it's not something that can be added as an afterthought.

Here are key aspects of building quality into software development:

1. **Testing as Prevention:** Automated testing is not just about finding defects; it's about preventing them. When developers write code with the expectation that it will be rigorously tested, they tend to produce higher-quality code from the start. This includes writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

2. **Clear Requirements:** Quality starts with clear and well-defined requirements. When requirements are ambiguous or incomplete, it can lead to misunderstandings and defects. Ensuring that requirements are precise helps prevent issues down the line.

3. **Continuous Integration:** Implementing continuous integration practices allows for regular integration and testing of code changes. This early detection of integration issues and conflicts contributes to overall software quality.

4. **Code Reviews:** Peer code reviews are an effective way to catch potential defects and ensure that code aligns with best practices. They promote knowledge sharing and help maintain coding standards.

5. **Automated Quality Checks:** Utilizing automated tools for code analysis, code formatting, and code style enforcement helps maintain consistency and improves code quality.

6. **Documentation:** Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation, including design documents, user manuals, and API references, contributes to overall software quality and helps prevent misunderstandings and errors.

7. **Feedback Loops:** Creating feedback loops in the development process allows for quick identification and resolution of issues. Teams should be encouraged to communicate openly about problems and improvements.

8. **User-Centric Design:** Building quality into the software also means designing with the end-users in mind. Understanding user needs and preferences helps create a product that meets their expectations.

By building quality into the development process, teams can reduce the cost of fixing defects, improve customer satisfaction, and deliver more reliable and valuable software products. It's a proactive approach that aligns with Lean principles and contributes to overall efficiency and effectiveness.
