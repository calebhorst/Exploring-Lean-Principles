## Defer Commitment
```
There's a tongue in cheek phrase that arose from the corruption of Chicago politics, vote early and often. The joke being that the election is rigged by the mob. Early on in my career, I adapted this phrase for my own purposes as a decision principle. Decide early and often. These two elements are obviously intention. You've got to have a kind of Zen thing where you're both decisive and yet flexible and adaptive to change without being indecisive. To put nuts and bolts to it, when you know that your decision may need to change tomorrow, you make a qualitatively different decision today. On the other hand, when you know that the weight of a particular decision may turn out to be low, this can help you get out of analysis paralysis and get to work. Let's not sweat every last detail when we understand that some of them are going to change along the way. Taiichi Ohno, compared a business's processes to a nervous system, "I think a business should have reflexes that can respond instantly and smoothly to small changes in the plan without having to go to the brain... The larger business, the better reflexes it needs." This is a very different approach than creating a detailed software specification and sticking to it until the end or, more likely, creating a detailed software specification and being intensely frustrated when it needs to change 3/4 of the way through the project. Decide early and often, and principle four, defer commitment.

## Notes
"Decide early and often" and "defer commitment" are important principles in the context of Lean software development. These principles highlight the need for flexibility, adaptability, and a balanced approach to decision-making in the software development process. Here's a breakdown of these principles:

**Decide Early and Often:**
- This principle encourages making decisions at appropriate points in the development process.
- Early decision-making ensures that the team has a clear direction and purpose from the beginning of the project.
- It acknowledges that some decisions may need to change as the project evolves, but it's essential to make the best decisions based on the available information at each stage.
- By deciding early and revisiting decisions when necessary, the team can avoid analysis paralysis and keep the project moving forward.
- It aligns with the idea that software development is a dynamic process where requirements and priorities may change over time.

**Defer Commitment:**
- Deferring commitment means not making irreversible decisions prematurely.
- In software development, many decisions can be deferred until more information is available or until the last responsible moment.
- It allows the team to adapt to changing requirements and market conditions without being locked into early, potentially incorrect decisions.
- Deferring commitment doesn't mean avoiding all decisions; it means making decisions when they provide the most value and deferring those that can wait.
- This principle supports agility and the ability to respond to customer feedback and changing priorities.

These principles work together to strike a balance between early decision-making for clarity and direction and deferring commitment to maintain flexibility. In Lean software development, the focus is on delivering value to the customer efficiently, and these principles help achieve that goal by reducing the risk of making premature or unnecessary decisions that can lead to waste.
