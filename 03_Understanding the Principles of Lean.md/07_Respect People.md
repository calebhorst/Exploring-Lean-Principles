## Respect People
```
The next principle, respect people, is very easy for those of us steeped in corporate culture to misunderstand. In a Lean context, respect people doesn't just mean be nice to people and it doesn't just mean encourage your workers. To get a grip on this, let's go back to the term Jidoka. Here are the kanji characters for Jidoka. Ji‑do‑ka. Ji, self. Do, movement or work. And ka is equivalent to the Asian suffix in English. The first character in this context means the worker who is self determined. Another relevant translation of Jidoka is automation with a human touch. Ohno understood that workers had the best information about the situation on the ground, the actual problems and challenges that they faced in eliminating waste and preventing defects. This principle circles back to trust people and give them the tools they need, an Agile principle we covered earlier. But in a deeper sense it is an understanding that there is more than one right way to do things. It means that people have to come together with respect and with the counterpart virtue to respect, humility, and understand that whatever it is that we are doing, it can be improved and should be.

## Notes
"Respect People" is a foundational principle in Lean software development that goes beyond mere politeness. It's about acknowledging the value of individuals within the organization and recognizing their potential to contribute to improvement. Here's a breakdown of this principle:

**Respect People:**
- In a Lean context, respecting people means valuing and empowering every member of the organization, from leadership to front-line workers.
- It's about creating an environment where people feel safe to voice their ideas, concerns, and insights without fear of retribution.
- Respecting people also involves acknowledging that individuals have valuable knowledge and experiences that can contribute to process improvement and problem-solving.
- It fosters a culture of continuous improvement, where everyone is encouraged to seek better ways of doing things and to challenge the status quo when necessary.
- Respect is closely tied to trust. When people feel respected, they are more likely to trust leadership, colleagues, and the organization as a whole.
- Embracing diversity, both in terms of backgrounds and perspectives, is an essential aspect of respecting people. It leads to more creative problem-solving and better decision-making.

**Balancing Principles:**
- "Respect People" complements other Lean principles like "create knowledge" and "optimize the whole." When individuals are respected and encouraged to contribute their knowledge, it leads to the creation of collective intelligence and more effective problem-solving.
- It aligns with Agile principles such as "build projects around motivated individuals" and "trust them to get the job done." Agile methodologies emphasize self-organizing teams and trust in individuals' abilities.

In summary, "Respect People" in Lean software development is about recognizing and honoring the capabilities, knowledge, and potential of every member of the organization. It creates a culture of collaboration, trust, and continuous improvement, where individuals are empowered to make positive contributions to the organization's success.
