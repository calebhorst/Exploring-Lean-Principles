## Relating Lean to Agile Principles
```
I think Lean and Agile relate to each other like this. This leads to the question, what's this part here? The part that Lean focuses on that Agile doesn't necessarily is the suboptimization. My earlier stories about work being waste are the proof of that. Part of this is the tyranny of the visible. Agile produces metrics, which makes certain aspects highly visible, but not necessarily the most important ones. In World War II, an analysis was made of where returning airplanes had been shot. It looked like this. Where would you armor the aircraft? Well, where the dots are obviously. Obvious, but wrong. This diagram was necessarily compiled from data from aircraft which had returned. What the data actually revealed was the places that an aircraft could be shot and still survive to return to base. The armor needed to go where the bullets weren't. Agile can do the same, because it makes a datum like velocity highly visible. It can make failing projects look like they're succeeding. It's important to consider where the bullets aren't going in your software projects.

## Notes
The relationship between Lean and Agile can be understood as a complementary one, where each approach addresses different aspects of the software development process. Here's a breakdown of their relationship and the role that Lean plays:

**Lean and Agile Relationship:**
- Lean and Agile share common values and principles related to efficiency, continuous improvement, and customer-centricity.
- Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, are often used within the framework of Lean principles to implement Lean concepts effectively in software development.
- Lean provides a broader strategic perspective on process optimization, while Agile focuses on the tactical aspects of delivering value incrementally and iteratively.

**The Role of Lean (Suboptimization):**
- Lean places a strong emphasis on eliminating waste and optimizing the entire value stream, including areas that Agile may not necessarily address directly.
- One of the areas Lean focuses on is avoiding suboptimization, which occurs when individual parts or teams of a process are optimized without considering their impact on the whole.
- Lean encourages organizations to look beyond local optimizations and consider how changes affect the entire system.
- Lean helps identify areas in the software development process where suboptimization may occur, such as over-optimizing development teams at the expense of other critical functions like testing or deployment.
- It reminds organizations to focus on the bigger picture, ensuring that improvements in one area don't lead to inefficiencies or waste elsewhere in the process.

**The Importance of Avoiding Suboptimization:**
- Suboptimization can be misleading, as it may produce local improvements but harm the overall performance of the software development process.
- For example, solely optimizing development speed (a common Agile focus) may result in unfinished work piling up in testing and deployment phases, ultimately slowing down the entire process.
- Lean encourages organizations to consider the end-to-end flow of value and address bottlenecks or constraints that could hinder the overall delivery.

In summary, Lean and Agile are like two pieces of a puzzle that fit together to create a comprehensive approach to software development. Lean's emphasis on avoiding suboptimization complements Agile's focus on iterative and incremental value delivery, helping organizations achieve sustainable improvements across the entire development process.
