## Introduction
```
Waste is clearer in a manufacturing process. A defective component, a part completed too late and, as Taiichi eliminated, a part completed too early. Here are the seven manufacturing wastes that Ohno identified: delay, overproduction, overprocessing, transportation, unnecessary movement, inventory, and most obviously, defects. The situation is less clear in software. We're going to spend this section talking about seven different ways that waste manifests itself in software processes. The Poppendieck's translated these manufacturing wastes into the Seven Software Wastes we're going to talk about.

## Notes
- In Lean processes, waste is evident in manufacturing but less clear in software development. 
- Taiichi Ohno identified seven manufacturing wastes, including delay, overproduction, overprocessing, transportation, unnecessary movement, inventory, and defects. 
- In software, waste manifests differently, leading to the identification of Seven Software Wastes.
