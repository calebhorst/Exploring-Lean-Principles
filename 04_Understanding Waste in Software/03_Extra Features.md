## Extra Features
```
Closely related to the idea of partially done work is the waste in the form of extra features. I'm going to introduce you to an actual acronym I try to keep close to my heart. YAGNI, you ain't gonna need it. We defer commitment in Lean because things change and because our understanding of how things are improves, or at least can improve the closer we get to the moment. Martin Fowler has a classic article on YAGNI here. Fowler identifies four costs for extra features. The cost of building. This is the obvious cost. The time that you have to pay developers for, plus the cost of tools and dependencies. Cost of repair. This cost reflects the possibility that you might need to redesign or recode in the future. This is the cost of bringing that feature back into the light. Cost of carry. Revisiting my documentâ€‘oriented data store from the previous section. If I'd abstracted out the data layer from the document calls that would have introduced complexity to the system. Every time that I needed to make an update to that code base, it would have taken somewhat longer because of the additional complexity introduced by that layer of abstraction. That is the cost of carry. Cost of delay. In economics, the cost of delay is an opportunity cost. What you gave up so that you could have this thing instead, this extra feature. Time and money you spend building useless feature A is time you could have spent making useful feature B. Or improving your test coverage, or pursuing a sane documentation method, or whatever Kaizen you could have implemented. In this story at that link, Fowler has a great diagram, which relates to the four costs to the nature of the features. He divides features into three buckets: wrong, right feature, built wrong, and right feature. Wrong features carry the cost of building, the cost of carry, and the cost of delay. Right feature, built wrong carries the cost of building, the cost of repair, the cost of carry and delay. And the right feature only the costs of carry and delay. So where does my missing abstraction layer fall in this chart? We can say ex post facto that it was the wrong feature because it was never needed, but we didn't know that for sure at the time. The basis for this decision that Fowler recommends is considering how hard it would be to refactor. It would have been difficult to refactor compared to the potential value it would yield. I was not careful about isolating data calls when I wrote it and if suddenly user concurrency became a big deal in the business, this would have been badly needed and quickly. So this means that it would not have been an extra feature, even though it was never used. That's a bit of an, if a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound, situation. But, that's the business we're in.

## Notes
- "You Ain't Gonna Need It" (YAGNI) is an acronym that emphasizes avoiding unnecessary or premature features in software development.
- Deferring commitment in Lean acknowledges that requirements and understanding can evolve as a project progresses.
- Martin Fowler identifies four costs associated with extra features:
  1. The cost of building, which includes developer time, tools, and dependencies.
  2. The cost of repair, which involves potential redesign or recoding in the future.
  3. The cost of carry, stemming from added complexity and time needed for maintenance.
  4. The cost of delay, representing the opportunity cost of working on less valuable features instead of more beneficial ones.
- Fowler's diagram categorizes features into three buckets: wrong features, right features built wrong, and right features.
- The decision to include or exclude a feature should consider how hard it would be to refactor and its potential value.
- Sometimes, features that seem unnecessary may become essential in the future, highlighting the uncertainty of software development.
