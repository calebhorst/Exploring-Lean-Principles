## Relearning
```
Have you ever written code and then had to look at the same code again a year later, after not having revisited in the time in between? Your reaction probably fell somewhere on the spectrum between, oh, yeah, this. And, this is entirely alien to anything I've ever seen. This is greatly amplified when the feature was left incomplete, in the form of partially done work. Whether or not the function actually works, if there was no test or documentation in whatever form that takes, you are faced with the task of relearning the code, our next form of waste. Another form that relearning takes is when the subject matter expert for the code, usually the author, can't work on it because they're either working on something else or because they've left the company. That leads to the next form of waste.
```

## Notes
- Code that hasn't been revisited for a long time can be challenging to understand, whether it's due to familiarity or changes in the codebase.
- Incomplete features, lacking tests or documentation, can be particularly difficult to relearn and work with after a long hiatus.
- Relearning waste also occurs when the subject matter expert for the code is unavailable, either due to their current work or departure from the company.
