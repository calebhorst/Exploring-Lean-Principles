## Task Switching
```
Nobody can multitask, at least not in the context of software work. The neuroscientists answered this question definitively. Let me put a finer definition to this so that it's clear. When I say nobody can multitask, I mean that when we add up the time to complete two programming tasks, the sum of those times will almost always be smaller if they're performed serially, instead of with task switching back and forth between the two. Anecdotally, about the only thing I allow myself to multitask with is audiobooks and exercise. And even then, if I'm listening to an especially difficult passage, I have to run it back and sit still to focus on it. That's the waste we're talking about. Everybody hears this, and they think, Oh, yeah. But I am good at multitasking and the cost of task switching isn't that much. So how much is that cost? Even brief mental blocks created by shifting between tasks can cost as much as 40% of someone's productive time. 40 flipping percent. The psychology of task switching identifies two cognitive processes involved: the goal shifting function whereby the mind identifies the switch between the tasks and the rule activation function whereby the mind applies the new set of rules for the new task. These two functions together are ruinous in cost compared to performing the tasks serially. And even this cost underestimates the waste associated with task switching, because it doesn't count the cost of rework when a task fails because you didn't dedicate enough focus to it. And in the meantime, after switching to a new task, the result of the previous task is, you guessed it, partially done work our first form of waste. I had a consultant once tell me that I needed to deliver the first phases of two separate projects on the same day, with work to follow for both of them. This was because she didn't want to tell the second client that they were being bumped for somebody else. I explained to her that I would do phase one for client A, then phase one for client B. But I wasn't going to switch back and forth between these two complex projects in the middle of the day, or even the week. The cost of task switching is probably far greater than you imagine.

## Notes
- Multitasking in the context of software work is typically inefficient and counterproductive.
- Neuroscientists have shown that task switching, or attempting to multitask, can cost as much as 40% of productive time due to cognitive processes related to shifting goals and activating new rules for each task.
- Task switching doesn't account for the additional cost of potential rework when a task fails due to insufficient focus.
- To illustrate the inefficiency of task switching, an example is given where two separate projects were scheduled to have their initial phases completed on the same day. However, it was more efficient to complete the first phase for one client entirely before moving on to the second client's project.
- The cost of task switching is often underestimated, and focusing on one task at a time can lead to better productivity and higher-quality work.
