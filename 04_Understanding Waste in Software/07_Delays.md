## Delays
```
In Lean, delays can do take two forms. The first is obvious, when you have to wait for approval for information, for the tools you need, for authorization, for somebody else to do the work. That's the obvious form of delay and the simpler form to address. You should be able to automate, standardize, and flatten org structures to fix that. I actually don't want to minimize the effort required to do that, but that's an easier problem to see, at least. The other sort of delay is much more subtle. I'll illustrate it by way of a riddle. Four people need to cross a bridge in 17 minutes. The bridge is narrow, such that only two people can cross, and it's dark, so someone must carry a flashlight in order to cross it. Tom could cross it in one minute, Jeff in two, George in five, and Roy in 10. At first glance, it seems impossible. The sum of their transit times, even with Tom the fastest traveler, returning the flashlight each time exceeds 17 minutes. Tom and Roy, Tom back, Tom and George, Tom back, and Tom and Jeff finally cross to the tune of 19 minutes. The solution lies in recognizing a fundamental truth to the timing. That we must have Roy and George cross together. Once we realize that, we can work backwards to arrange this: Tom and Jeff cross, Tom returns, George and Roy cross together, Jeff returns, Tom and Jeff cross together, 17 minutes. In my career, software projects have often had these same sort of fundamental truths when it came to avoiding these kinds of delays. Once I was tasked with creating a single sign‑on between two sites, whereby a user signs into their company portal and then that identity is federated to my site without the user having to enter their username and password again. It took me a while to wrap my head around the crypto involved, but I eventually got it figured out and the code was complete. All I needed to do now was to get the certificates ordered, and we could go live the next day. That's when I discovered how long it takes a Fortune 50 company to approve a new certificate that validates their corporate identity. We first had to find someone on the other end who was the point of contact for their domain, and their domain registration was private. That took a few days. Then that person outlined the internal process they had for new certificates. We were actually lucky that one existed, but this was a 30‑day process, minimum. We ended up having to talk to people who had nothing to do with the project and sell them that this was a legitimate and useful application for the risk that creating this certificate would involve. Finally, about two months after we'd begun the process, we had the certificates for staging and production, and we were able to go live. Thereafter, whenever I had an SSO project, I made sure that the first step was to get the certificate process started.

## Notes
- Delays in Lean processes can manifest in two forms: the obvious and the subtle.
- The obvious form of delay involves waiting for approvals, information, tools, authorization, or someone else to complete work. This type of delay can often be addressed through automation, standardization, and organizational changes.
- The subtle form of delay can be illustrated through a riddle involving four people needing to cross a bridge in 17 minutes. The solution lies in recognizing fundamental truths, such as the need for specific people to cross together, to optimize the timing.
- An example from the software development world involves the delay caused by the lengthy process of obtaining a corporate identity certificate for single sign-on. This delay was unexpected and significantly impacted the project timeline, highlighting the importance of understanding and addressing subtle delays early in the process.
