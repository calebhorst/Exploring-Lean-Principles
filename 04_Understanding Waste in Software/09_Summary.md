## Summary
```
Given that the purpose of the seven principles we discussed in the previous section was to eliminate waste. These seven wastes are the inverse of one or more principles. Extra features is inadequately deferred commitment. Relearning is an indication that you failed to create knowledge, and defects are a failure to build quality in. It's worth asking which of these inverse principles corresponds to each form of waste. We covered partially done work, extra features, relearning, handoffs, task switching, delays and, of course, defects. In the last section, we're going to switch to full war story mode and talk about my experiences in applying these principles, mitigating these wastes, and how you can do it in your own enterprise.
