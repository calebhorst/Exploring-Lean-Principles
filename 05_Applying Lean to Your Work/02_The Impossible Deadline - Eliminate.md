## The Impossible Deadline - Eliminate, Eliminate, Eliminate
```
Whenever someone tells me that a deadline can't be moved, I ask if the deadline is driven by a legal reporting requirement, like this document has to be publicly available 30 days before some such event. That's a real thing. And it's just about the only time when deadlines really cannot be moved. At the company I mentioned earlier, the one I'd worked at for eight years, I worked with consultant, we'll call her Lauren, and we had one of these kinds of projects. One morning she came into my office and explained that we had a huge problem. The customer had just sent a data file to us way ahead of schedule, and they told Lauren that we had to have the ETL portion of the project, the part that extracts the data from the file, transforms it into the target format, and loads it into the database. That part had to be ready and executed in less than a week. She knew that this would be difficult, but I explained to her that it would be impossible. Now what a developer tells you that something is impossible, you should press for detail. I'll show you why. It truly was impossible to get that ETL ready in less than a week. Their data files were extremely complex and relied on files from multiple vendors, most of which we didn't even have sample files for. Knowing what I did about Lean I pressed back, Why specifically do we need the ETL done in this timeline? She answered that it was because the customer needed to begin entering this data in the admin tools that I had already created and deployed. If they can't do that by that date, they won't be able to launch on time and we'll miss the legal window I've mentioned. Okay, so really, we only need this part of the ETL, the part necessary to get those base objects into the database that they would then hang their manually entered data off of. We could simply get this part of ETL working and they could enter the data. Yeah, that would work. Still a tight fit for less than a week. We pressed further. Wait a minute. A lot of the ETL work is configuration and deployment. I could just run the tools manually against the database for the first time to get them up and running, right? That would only take me maybe an hour or two. And we're not going to be getting a new data file for a few weeks, anyway. We can run the ETL process on my development machine just this once, and then use the time that buys us to finish out the tools. Yeah. We pressed further. An epiphany dawned across her face and she said, Wait a minute. Don't the admin tools already have a capability to add objects that are missing from the data file? They did. And that was already up and deployed to the test site. We realized that there were only about 30 of these objects in the current data file, so she pulled up the test site on her laptop, sat there and entered them over the next 15 minutes. Our weeklong deadline, which was impossible at the top of the meeting, was met in under 30 minutes. But it was the right 30 minutes.

## Notes
- Deadlines in software development are often movable, except in cases involving legal reporting requirements.
- The story involves a tight deadline for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) portion of a project.
- The project deadline was initially considered impossible to meet.
- By questioning the specific need and breaking down the requirements, it became clear that only a subset of the ETL was needed.
- Further analysis revealed that manual execution and configuration could expedite the process.
- Ultimately, the team discovered that a simple, manual data entry task could meet the deadline in a matter of minutes, instead of a week.
- The key takeaway is to challenge assumptions and break down tasks to find creative solutions to meet deadlines.
