## Kanban in Intensive Care
```
One of the things that happens when you're an engineer watching your father die is you get to know the data the hospital uses to track the health of the patient: systole and diastole, blood, oxygen, and white count. Your mind turns to something, anything, to avoid the weight of the situation. And for people like us, that means clinging to data. Towards the end, my dad had multiple system failures. He had a terrible infection which landed him on a ventilator. After fighting off the infection, the mass of the defeated bacteria overwhelmed his kidneys, which landed him on dialysis. When he was a young man, he'd been exposed to benzene, working as a chemist. So he had a form of cancer associated with that which complicated everything and ultimately caused his death. The doctors did their best. When his blood oxygen would fall too low, there was an alarm, an auditory Kanban. When his pulse would fall too low, the color would change, a visual signal, a Kanban that there was a problem that needed to be addressed. Aside from the stereotypical chart for the patient indicating the state of health, the nurses would write note cards to the next shift, indicating what they'd done and what needed to come next. A literal form of Kanban. The lesson I'm trying to impart with this sad story is that the care providers weren't focused on a single datum, like pulse or white count. They had to see all of the data in coordination with each other if they had any shot at saving my dad. But in the practice of software, Kanban tends to end with the data that our tools have automated for us. Kanban is strongly practiced in signaling the state of work items through the lifecycle, and most good tools will represent team velocity and overall project state in the form of a burn down or burn up chart. The problem with this is that these are mostly positive indicators. They're indicating whether or not you're succeeding. The only way to measure problems is the lack of these measures. Low velocity, a long burn down, and measuring churn with your boards is even harder. I'm not knocking these measures, by all means pay attention to them, but they're not enough. If you're familiar with Agile, you should be familiar with story grooming. The process whereby you're adding detail, clarifying, and preparing this story to be a success for the team. This is important work, but let's say that a story fails. The character of failure could be a number of things. It could be that the story causes regression, that it results in a defect, or could simply be that the story was never needed in the first place, and it's waste. What successful organizations do is instead of analyzing how they're succeeding, they analyze how they fail. We take it for granted, properly, that we need to groom our stories so that they can succeed. How much more value could we get by grooming our defects? In the Azure DevOps system, for example, you could associate a story with a branch of code or even a single commit. This means that what a pull request is executed, the commit is associated with a build, which is in turn associated back to that story. Then, when you're testing or your customer reveals a defect, simply tying the defect to a build attaches it to the story or stories that drove the process that created the defect in the first place. This ties it to the commit, to the developer, to everything. If you have your story with the right epics and tags, you can compose this information all together and find out why your process is failing, and what you can do about it. If your defects accrue to security problems, you can implement security analysis tools in your build that will break it if they find a problem. This will feed back to the developers who will learn what the problems are and not write the problems in the first place, in a virtuous cycle. Or you might see that most of your defects are associated with a particular part of the code, a signal that the code should be more heavily tested, or rewritten, or maybe replaced with a thirdâ€‘party library from a company with a quality process that you can leverage.

## Notes
- The author reflects on their experience as an engineer dealing with their father's health issues in the hospital.
- In the hospital, medical professionals relied on multiple data points and indicators to assess the patient's health, not just a single datum.
- In software development, Kanban often focuses on automated data related to work items and project state.
- The author emphasizes the importance of analyzing how failures occur in software development, not just how successes happen.
- Grooming defects and associating them with the story, commit, and build can help identify why and how failures occur.
- The author suggests using security analysis tools to catch defects and establish a feedback loop for developers to learn and improve.
- Identifying patterns of defects can lead to code improvements, increased testing, or replacing problematic code with third-party solutions.
- The key takeaway is to pay attention to how failures occur in the software development process and use data to drive improvements.
