## The Five Whys
```
We've moved into an area that ties directly back to the manufacturing routes of Lean, Root Cause Analysis. One of the most powerful tools for RCA is The Five Why's. The Five Why's is a technique developed by Sakichi Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno where you ask why a defect occurred five times, driving more deeply with each question and seeking the root cause for the problem. Here's an example. Chernobyl was the worst nuclear reactor disaster in history. Why? Because the operator attempted to restart the reactor too quickly after it had fallen below a critical rate of reactivity. Why? Because he was ordered to by his superior. Why? Because they were desperate to complete a test that was months behind schedule. Why? Because the reactor had been built too quickly in order to meet arbitrary deadlines. Why? Because the organization had a culture that placed political ends over the concerns of engineers. In short, the answer to the final why is that people didn't listen. The Challenger shuttle disaster killed seven astronauts. Why? Because an O‑ring didn't deform properly to maintain a seal in a solid rocket booster. Why? Because the shuttle was launched when the outside temperature was below the range within which the material in the O‑ring reacted properly. It was too cold. Why? Because NASA administrators had ordered the launch. Why? Because NASA culture promoted can do attitudes over people who talked about problems and grossly underestimated the rate of failure per launch. Why? Because the organization had a culture that placed political ends over the concerns of engineers. Again, the final why is that people didn't listen. NASA had learned the lesson of Apollo 1, and had gotten much better at imagining failure. But once their engineers had imagined failure, it was the duty of the administrators to listen to them. Chernobyl happened in a system designed from top to bottom on the premise of the infallibility of the state and of central planning. There was no andon for the Chernobyl operators to pull, or for the reactor designers, or for the community that would be shattered when the reactor exploded on April 26, 1986. In the end, all engineering failures happen for a combination of two reasons; a failure of imagination and a failure to listen. Lean can give us good tools to help us imagine failure, but it's our duty to listen to what we are told, no matter who it comes from, as an implication of the respect people principle.

## Notes
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a powerful tool in Lean manufacturing for identifying the underlying causes of defects or problems.
- The Five Why's is an RCA technique where you ask "why" multiple times (typically five) to delve deeper into the root cause of an issue.
- The author provides examples of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster and the Challenger shuttle disaster to illustrate the importance of RCA.
- In both disasters, the final "why" reveals a common theme: a failure to listen to engineers and experts.
- RCA helps identify issues, but it's crucial for organizations to foster a culture of listening and taking action based on the insights from RCA.
- Lean principles can aid in imagining failure and improving processes, but it's essential to heed the warnings and recommendations of those who identify potential problems.
- Ultimately, engineering failures often result from a combination of a lack of imagination and a failure to listen to concerns and warnings.
