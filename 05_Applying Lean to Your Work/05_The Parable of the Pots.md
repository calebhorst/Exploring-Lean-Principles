## The Parable of the Pots
```
There's an old story which was originally told in the book, Art and Fear. A ceramics teacher divides his classroom in two, declaring that the left half would be judged by the quality of the work they create, ceramic pots. The right half would be judged solely on the quantity of work they produced 30 pounds to pass, 40 pounds for a B, 50 pounds for an A. The left side of the class could spend as much time as they wanted considering and planning what the perfect pot would be. They could produce a single pot if that's what they wanted. The right side didn't have this luxury. They needed to roll up their sleeves and get to work as soon as possible to hit their deadlines. Whether or not the pots were any good. One might expect that, given all the time designing, planning, and considering the nature of the perfect pot that the left half the class would yield the great art of the pot. But it didn't. Consistently, the best pots were created by the quantity graded half of the class. While the left half was contemplating what the problems might be, the right half of the class was applying practical experience to these problems. This goes back to the deliver fast principle, and it dovetails with the Agile principle of delivering in short increments. The left half of the class was big design up front and right half of the class was Agile, driven by timeboxing, like Agile is. The right half of the class was producing and approving in a way that can only occur with experience. Let me revisit something I said earlier. The work of software is research. If you look at your software work and you disagree with this assessment, if your work is predictable and deterministic, congratulations you're ready to automate. But everything in software not ready to automate is what is referred to as a wicked problem. Wikipedia defines a wicked problem as, a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. I worked with an old Russian programmer who told me a story from the days of the Soviet Union. With a subsidy from the government, the local butcher shop would sell meat for less than they paid the farmers for it. This was obviously intended to keep the price of food low and keep the poor people fed. What happened instead was that the butcher would sell the meat back to the farmer, who would then sell the meat back to the butcher in secret. The butcher would pocket the subsidy for each round of this, and the farmer would make money selling the same beef and chicken over and over again until it was spoiled. The net effect was that meat was made more scarce than it would have been if the butcher and farmer had simply dealt with each other on market prices. I think this sort of planning is partially a wicked problem that was difficult to foresee and also a case of planners not listening to economists, or maybe economists not talking because they were afraid of getting shot. But the point here is that in certain problems you have confounding variables which change in response to the nature of the problem. And the only way to be able to predict the nature of the solution is to at least partially execute the work. This is the nature of software and why it is, for example, so difficult to estimate.

## Notes
- A ceramics class teacher divided students into two groups: one judged on the quality of a single ceramic pot and the other on the quantity of pots produced within a set time frame.
- Surprisingly, the group judged on quantity consistently produced better pots than the group focused on quality.
- This story illustrates the importance of delivering work in short increments and the value of practical experience in problem-solving.
- Software development is often characterized by wicked problems, which are difficult to solve due to incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements.
- Wicked problems require an iterative approach because the nature of the solution often becomes clearer only through partial execution of the work.
- The story of the Soviet butcher and farmer highlights how confounding variables can impact problem-solving, making it essential to engage in practical work to predict and understand the nature of the solution.
- Estimating software development can be challenging due to the ever-changing nature of requirements and variables.
