## Cycle Time
```
Earlier I mentioned the days when I was the developer for an application we provided phone support for. This is the one where I would call the customers directly. While calling the customers directly was better than pushing the tickets back to the support interns and having them call the customer back from more information, it was still wasting something. The customer's time. Instead of calling once and delivering all of the information necessary to get the problem resolved and then simply receiving a notification that their problem was solved, they had to talk to us a second time. These are two suboptimal cycles, one where I dig in my heels and I tell the manager to tell the support engineer to call the customer back, and the other where I call them back directly. Why didn't we have the obvious optimal cycle where the support engineer gets all the data in the first place necessary to solve the problem? Because the support engineers were sub‑optimizing. The support engineers were paid on the basis of how many calls they took. While this provided a good incentive to resolve the issues speedily, it also meant that when there was a more complex issue that was going to end up landing on my plate, those longer calls literally were costing them money. As a developer, I was much more expensive to the company than the support operators. So this was, fortunately, a signal to everyone involved that we needed to optimize the whole. We needed to figure out how to do one of two things. Either deliver all the information I needed the first time, making me a satisfied customer of their phase of the process, or even better, eliminate my phase from the process entirely. We attacked both sides of the equation. It was quick and easy to map out which data we're missing from most of the requests that I had worked on. We modified the entry form for the support tool and made those new fields mandatory. This meant sometimes gathering information that wasn't strictly germane to the problem, but the small cost of the time spent gathering that was outweighed by the cost of my time spent cycling back and forth. Note here, you have to determine whether this is the case. If my involvement were rarer or the time spent getting the additional information longer, this itself might have been a sub‑optimization. What really fix the problem was another step we took by examining the nature of the problems that we were getting. We realized the core problem that the support engineers were having was that they couldn't see what the customer was seeing. The site we were supporting had complex logic that drove a UI based off a very particular customer data, the completion of wellness activities, like getting 10,000 steps in a day. When all the UI elements lined up right, they'd get a prize from the company, and sometimes the customers would wonder why an individual element appeared the way it did, and they'd call in. Without the ability to see what exactly the customer saw on their page, the support engineers would have to guess at the problem. To fix this problem, we added an impersonation function to the admin tools that the operators had. With this in place, they would ask the employee their employee number or their name, search them up, click, impersonate, and then they could see exactly what the customer did. That took me about a day and a half. Implementing this meant that we needed to run background checks on the operators, which we did, and they all passed with no problems. With the new tool in place, no issue ever reached me again. Furthermore, the operators would now perform the impersonation as the first step, and most calls would be resolved under a minute. We had an unexamined and false premise that only I, as the developer, could wield the tools and the responsibility that came with the increased level of access that the operators needed to do their job. Because of this, we had a sub‑optimized process with a longer cycle time than was needed and using more expensive resources than needed. Once we applied the respect people principle and gave them the tools they needed, we were able to optimize the whole.

## Notes
- Phone support for an application led to suboptimal customer experiences and wasted time as customers had to engage in two communication cycles.
- Support engineers were incentivized based on the number of calls they took, which discouraged longer calls and complex issues, passing them to the more expensive developer.
- The goal was to optimize the process by either collecting all necessary information from the customer in the first interaction or eliminating the need for developer involvement.
- New mandatory fields were added to the support tool's entry form to gather essential data, even if not directly related to the problem.
- An impersonation function was introduced in the admin tools used by support operators, allowing them to see the customer's view and reducing the need for developer intervention.
- The addition of impersonation significantly improved issue resolution times, with most calls resolved in under a minute.
- The false premise that only developers could handle certain tasks and responsibilities led to suboptimal processes, longer cycle times, and higher costs.
- Applying the "respect people" principle and providing the necessary tools to support operators helped optimize the entire support process.
