## Parting Thoughts
```
This course is a necessarily light treatment of Lean. I could do a course each on the Seven Principles. While the Poppendieck books are legendary and I highly recommend you read them, I've worked hard here to give you content that comes only from my own experience and research. Otherwise, I've wasted your time, and you would have been better served just reading the book. The flip side of that is now you'll get maximum benefit from reading the books. So again, read the books. You won't regret the time spent. It might seem ridiculous that we as human beings should be passionate about processes and automation when there are songs to be sung and mountains to climb. But this fundamentally misunderstands what processes are, processes are the story of people solving problems together. When we can solve each other's problems effectively, in a way consistent with respect and human dignity, this is something it is worthy to be passionate about. The story of Lean begins with a clever little boy wishing he could lighten his mother's burden to give her more time to spend laughing and singing and playing with him. What could your compassion and intelligence create tomorrow? Thank you very much for watching, good luck and happy coding.
